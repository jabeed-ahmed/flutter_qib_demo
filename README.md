## Flutter Demo Bloc 

A GitHub repository which contains the complete source code of the flutter app using Bloc pattern. 

### Description

As we developer know, it is always good to maintain the clean code. This project is completely based on bloc architecture using the mock aps with some dummy data. https://designer.mocky.io/design. The good thing with this link is that you can create your own dummy APIs with your own set of JSON data.

This app contain 3 screens which are Splash Screen, Login Screen (Static) and Home Screen. When user opens login scree, the device checks for the bio metric where user can scan his finger and directly navigates user to Home Screen. 

An Home Screen contains three main widgets where three different apis has been called in order to get the data and display it on the same screen itself. Here the screen demonstrates the BloC pattern where it helps with organizing data flows, and today itâ€™s the most popular pattern for Flutter development.
